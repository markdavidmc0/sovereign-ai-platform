# Sovereign AI Platform: The Unified Execution Fabric

The Sovereign AI Platform is a Systems-First architecture designed to replace brittle MLOps pipelines with a Durable Execution Fabric. It treats Data, Ops, and Infra as a single, stateful organism, ensuring that enterprise intelligence is resilient, sovereign, and high-performance.

## The Manifesto
- Durable over Stateless: We don't build pipelines; we build stateful workflows (Temporal).
- Semantic over Syntactic: We don't log strings; we trace Pydantic objects (Logfire).
- Dispatchable over Packaged: We don't wait for Docker builds; we dispatch remote code (Runhouse).
- Kinetic over Static: We don't serve models; we deploy co-optimized appliances (vLLM + Qdrant).
